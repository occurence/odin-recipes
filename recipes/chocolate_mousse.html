    <h1>Chocolate Mousse</h1>
    <img src="../images/chocomousse.jpg" width="300">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A beginners technique for a delicious and most perfectly-textured mousse:</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 1/2 ounces dark chocolate (62% cacao is ideal)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        <li>1 tiny pinch salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chilled heavy whipping cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Break up or chop chocolate into small pieces and set aside with butter.</li>
        <li>Add egg yolks, sugar, water, and salt to a metal mixing bowl. Cook, whisking, directly over medium-low heat until the mixture is thick, foamy, and hot to the touch (145 to 150 degrees F (63 to 65 degrees C)). </li>
        <li>Once the yolk mixture is thick and hot, add chocolate and butter, and whisk until all chocolate is melted. Let rest for a few minutes on the counter, whisking occasionally to further cool the mixture to just above or at room temperature. The chocolate mixture shouldnâ€™t go into the whipped cream while still warm, but if cooled too long, the mixture may get too firm to fold in.</li>
        <li>Whisk cold cream until medium stiff peaks form. If cream is whisked further, it will separate and the final texture will be grainy.</li>
        <li>Transfer about 1/3 of chocolate mixture into whipped cream, and fold with a spatula until almost incorporated. Gently fold in remaining chocolate, trying to keep as much air in the mixture as possible.</li>
        <li>Transfer into 4 serving dishes, wrap, and chill before serving, at least 1 hour.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Chef's Note</h3>
    <p>You can use 1/4 cup water as specified, or you can use another liquid for part of the water, such as a combination of 2 tablespoons water + 2 tablespoons cold coffee, or 3 tablespoons water + 1 tablespoon rum, if you would like a flavor other than pure chocolate for your mousse.</p>
