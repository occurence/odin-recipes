    <h1>Parmesan Cabbage</h1>
    <img src="../images/parmesan.jpg" width="300">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>If you've never tried roasting cabbage before, let this recipe be your reason to start:</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 ounces Parmesan cheese, shredded (about 3/4 cup)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried italian seasoning blend</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 small (2 pounds) head cabbage, cut into 8 (1 1/2-inch) wedges</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) with racks in top third and lower third positions. Line 2 large-rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Stir together Parmesan cheese, oil, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, salt, and paprika in a small bowl until cheese is well coated in oil mixture.</li>
        <li>Evenly spread Parmesan mixture on one side of each cabbage wedge (about 2 tablespoons per wedge) and arrange, paste side down, on the prepared baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cabbage is tender-crisp and Parmesan creates a golden brown crust on bottom of cabbage, 16 to 18 minutes, rotating pans between top and bottom racks and from front to back halfway through.</li>
        <li>Remove cabbage from oven, and let stand undisturbed for 2 minutes, before using a spatula to release cabbage wedges from baking sheets. Turn cabbage wedges over, cheese side up; and bake at 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) until cabbage is tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
